                        Hi, my name is Cat Kenzie! I’m a Firmware Engineer who recently relocated to the South San Francisco Bay area after graduation. I’m excited by facing new challenges, connecting with the community, and discovering more about our world each day. 
                        <br><br>
                        I like understanding how machines operate on a deep level, so I appreciate the low level approach firmware engineering takes when solving problems.
                        <br><br>
                        My studies focused on <b> embedded systems, signal processing, and control systems. </b> I have experience designing and developing embedded systems using <b> C, Verilog HDL, ARM and Python </b> to control ADC/DACs, motors, ultrasonic sensors, speakers, resistive touchscreens, among other peripherals. 
                        <br><br> 
                        Currently in my work I troubleshoot customer's product issues using bash commands and postgreSQL queries. In my free time I've been learning HTML/CSS. 
                        <br><br>
                        I’m looking for a role to use my toolbox of skills to create specialized technological solutions that benefit others and elevate the collective.
                        When I am away from a screen you will find me learning skateboard tricks, testing out new vegetarian recipes, and sharing my love of electronic music with others.

                <h3> DOWNBEAT </h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/catkenzie/downbeat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                <img src='photos/db_classification.png'>
                </a>
                <p>
                    For the final project in our digital signal processing lab, my team designed and prototyped a tool for drummers to transcribe their musical ideas. Downbeat processes a single audio input of a drum kit then generates and displays the corresponding sheet music in real time. The drum classification is implemented in C on an STM32 Nucleo microprocessor and the transcription is implemented in Python on a Raspberry Pi 4.     <br>

                <h3> GESTURE-BASED MIDI SEQUENCER </h3>
                <img class="nolink" src='photos/embeated.png'>
                <p>
                    In our embedded systems class my team developed and built an electronic MIDI sequencer. We traded out the typical knobs and buttons controls for distance sensors and accelerometers to implement a machine with controls that parallel the intuitive gestures used when playing a classic musical instrument. 
                    <br>
                </p>
            

                <h3> VOCAL HARMONIZER </h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/catkenzie/vocal-harmonizer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                <img src='photos/mic.jpg'>
                </a>
                <p>
                    I created a vocal harmonizing tool capable of harmonizing with singers during live performances. The algorithm windows an vocal audio track, extracts the relevant frequencies that maintain the voice’s timbre, and pitch shifts the audio by harmonic ratios to generate a robotic chorus. The original MATLAB project has been extended to C code and exported as a VST to be used as a plugin in modern DAWs (digital audio workstations). 
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h3> CIRCUIT SORT AND SIMULATOR </h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/catkenzie/circuit-simulator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                <img src='photos/circuit_sim.png'>
                </a>
                <p>
                    I created this C++ project in my logic circuit synthesis and optimization course to illustrate the functional simulation of digital circuits. The 2-part algorithm tkaes a circuit written in blif file form as input, then generates a topological ordering of the circuit and simulates the output propogation for a given input vector. 
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h3> ASSEMBLER </h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/catkenzie/assembler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                <img src='photos/ass.png'>
                </a>
                <p>
                    Over the duration of my computer organization course, I wrote programs to simulate the ‘LC-2K’, an 8-register, 32-bit computer with 64kB memory that is capable of solving complex problems. This specific C algorithm turns assembly code into machine code based on the LC-2K instruction set architecture.
                    <br>

                <h3>RPN CALCULATOR </h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/catkenzie/calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                <img src='photos/rpn.jpg'> 
                </a>
                <p>
                    For my programming and data structures course I designed a reverse polish notation calculator supporting basic operations on integers and floats. The algorithm is implemented with a doubly-linked list functioning as the calculator’s stack.
